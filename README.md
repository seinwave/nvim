TODO:

- configure ruby lsp so it stops showing annoying suggestions
- test out typescript lsp
- find a good java lsp(?) -- probably not worth it
- figure out how to do rubocop, etc with nvim
- check out the rest of primeagen's tutorial
- figure out some good keybindings for LSP stuff - primeagen's suggestions are prolly good
